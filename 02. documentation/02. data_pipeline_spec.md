## **2. Data Transformation**
Transformation processes prepare raw ingested data for analysis and reporting, ensuring the data is clean, consistent, and aligned with the required schema.

### **2.1 Data Cleaning**
- **Duplicate Removal**: Identify and remove duplicate records.
- **Null Value Handling**: Handle missing or null values through default values, estimates, or removal.
- **Format Standardization**: Ensure consistent formats for dates, strings, and numeric values.

### **2.2 Data Normalization**
- **Schema Alignment**: Map raw data to the predefined schema for storage in the data lake or warehouse.
- **Categorization**: Organize the data into the relevant personal growth categories (e.g., Skill Development, Community Contribution, Professional Development).

### **2.3 Aggregation**
- **Metric Calculation**: Calculate key metrics such as total followers gained, projects completed, or impressions over time.
- **Historical Analysis**: Aggregate data for historical trends (e.g., month-over-month analysis of GitHub commits or LinkedIn followers).

---

## **3. Data Storage**
Once transformed, data will be stored in a scalable environment to enable querying, analysis, and long-term retention.

### **3.1 Storage Solutions**
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**: Raw data will be stored in the data lake as unprocessed, original records.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Processed and transformed data will be stored in the data warehouse for analytical querying and reporting.

### **3.2 Data Retention**
- **Raw Data**: Retained in the data lake for a defined period (e.g., 12 months) before archiving or deletion.
- **Transformed Data**: Stored indefinitely in the data warehouse for historical analysis and reporting.

### **3.3 Data Schema**
- **Tables**:
  - `personal_projects`: Stores details about completed personal projects.
  - `community_contributions`: Tracks engagement metrics from platforms like LinkedIn and Substack.
  - `professional_development`: Tracks data related to job applications, client engagements, and professional networking.
  - `learning_progress`: Stores data on completed courses, books, and certifications.

## **4. Data Serving**
The pipeline will provide access to data for reporting, dashboards, and machine learning models. The data must be available in real-time or near-real-time for end users.

### **4.1 Reporting Layer**
- **Power BI Integration**: Data will be served to Power BI for visualization. Real-time dashboards will display growth metrics such as project completions, engagement rates, and skill development trends.
- **API Access**: Data will be accessible via an API for integration with other tools or manual querying.

### **4.2 Querying**
- **Azure Synapse Queries**: Users will be able to run queries on the data warehouse to generate custom reports or perform ad-hoc analysis.
- **Aggregated Views**: Pre-aggregated views will be created for commonly accessed metrics (e.g., total monthly engagement, year-over-year project completions).

---

## **5. Orchestration**
Orchestration ensures that the different components of the pipeline work together smoothly and efficiently.

### **5.1 Orchestration Tool**
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: ADF will be used to orchestrate the data flow, manage dependencies between tasks, and schedule regular data ingestion, transformation, and loading jobs.

### **5.2 Scheduling**
- **Real-Time Tasks**: Triggered via APIs as data is available from platforms (e.g., LinkedIn).
- **Batch Jobs**: Scheduled for specific times (e.g., nightly or weekly jobs to ingest manual data).

### **5.3 Dependency Management**
- **Task Dependencies**: Ensure that data is only transformed once ingestion is complete, and reporting is updated only after transformation.
- **Failure Handling**: Implement retry logic and alerts for failed tasks to ensure data pipeline reliability.

## **6. Monitoring and Alerts**
Monitoring ensures the health of the pipeline and alerts administrators when there are issues with data ingestion, transformation, or serving.

### **6.1 Monitoring Tools**
- **Azure Monitor**: Monitor pipeline performance, task success rates, and data integrity.
- **Data Freshness Checks**: Ensure that real-time data is being ingested and processed as expected.
  
### **6.2 Alerts**
- **Failure Alerts**: Send alerts for failed jobs, data ingestion issues, or transformation errors.
- **Data Quality Alerts**: Notify administrators if data does not meet quality thresholds (e.g., missing data, schema mismatch).
