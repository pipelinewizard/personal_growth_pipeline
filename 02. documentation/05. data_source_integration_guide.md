# **Data Source Integration Guide for Personal Growth Data Pipeline**

## **Introduction**
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for integrating various data sources into the personal growth data pipeline. It covers the integration of platforms such as LinkedIn, Substack, GitHub, and other relevant sources. The integration process will ensure that data is ingested in a structured and consistent manner, supporting the pipeline’s goals of tracking personal growth metrics across multiple platforms.

---

## **1. Objectives**
The objectives of this integration guide are to:
- Outline the procedures for connecting external data sources to the data pipeline.
- Ensure data is ingested in the correct format (CSV, JSON, API).
- Provide guidelines for error handling during the ingestion process.
- Describe how to extend the pipeline for future data sources.

---

## **2. Supported Data Sources**
The following platforms will be integrated into the pipeline for tracking personal growth metrics:

- **LinkedIn**: Track metrics such as followers, profile views, post engagements (likes, comments, shares).
- **Substack**: Track subscriber count, article reads, impressions, and engagement metrics.
- **GitHub**: Track contributions, commits, repositories, and followers.
- **Coursera/Other Learning Platforms**: Track courses completed, certifications earned.
- **Threads**: Track followers, engagement metrics (comments, likes).

## **3. Integration Steps**

### **3.1 API-Based Data Sources**
Many platforms, such as LinkedIn and GitHub, provide APIs to access their data. The steps below outline how to integrate API-based data sources.

#### **Step 1: Obtain API Credentials**
- **Action**: Register your application on the respective platform’s developer portal to obtain API keys or OAuth tokens.
    - **LinkedIn API**: [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/)
    - **GitHub API**: [GitHub Developer Portal](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)
    - **Substack API**: [Substack API Documentation](https://substack.com/developers)
- **Credentials**: Ensure you have API keys, client secrets, and OAuth tokens as required by the platform.

#### **Step 2: Define API Endpoints**
- **Action**: Identify the API endpoints to pull the necessary data from each platform.
    - **LinkedIn**: Use the `people`, `engagement`, and `analytics` endpoints to gather profile views, post engagement, and follower data.
    - **GitHub**: Use the `repos`, `commits`, and `followers` endpoints to track contributions and followers.

#### **Step 3: Develop API Integration Scripts**
- **Action**: Write Python scripts to connect to the APIs and pull the data.
    - **Libraries**: Use libraries such as `requests` or `httpx` for API calls.
    - **Authentication**: Implement OAuth authentication where necessary.
    - **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling for rate limits, authentication failures, and timeouts.

#### **Step 4: Schedule API Calls**
- **Action**: Use Azure Data Factory or another orchestration tool to schedule API calls at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
    - **Frequency**: Define the frequency of API calls based on the platform and data availability.
    - **Logging**: Set up logging to track successful data pulls and errors for troubleshooting.

`````python
import requests

# Example: Fetch LinkedIn Profile Metrics
url = "https://api.linkedin.com/v2/me"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    # Process data...
else:
    print("Error fetching data:", response.status_code)
`````

### **3.2 File-Based Data Sources (CSV, JSON)**
-Some platforms may not have APIs, or you may need to manually download data files (e.g., CSV or JSON).

#### Step 1: Identify the Source and Format
- Action: Determine where the files will come from (manual upload, SFTP, or third-party platforms) and what format the data will be in (CSV, JSON, etc.).
#### Step 2: Set Up File Ingestion Pipelines
- Action: Develop file ingestion pipelines using Azure Data Factory or Databricks to process CSV/JSON files.
    - CSV: Parse the CSV files using Python’s pandas library.
    - JSON: Use Python’s json module to parse JSON data.
`````python
import pandas as pd

# Example: Ingest CSV data
df = pd.read_csv('path/to/linkedin_data.csv')
# Process dataframe...

import json

# Example: Ingest JSON data
with open('path/to/substack_data.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
# Process JSON data...
`````
#### Step 3: Automate File Ingestion
- Action: Automate the ingestion of files using triggers or schedules in Azure Data Factory.
- Manual Upload: If manual uploads are required, create an interface for uploading files into the data lake.
- Automated: Set up pipelines for SFTP or shared folder integrations where applicable.
### 3.3 Extending the Pipeline for New Data Sources
#### Step 1: Analyze the Data Source
- Action: For new data sources, evaluate whether the data will be available through APIs, files (CSV/JSON), or web scraping.
    - Example: If a new social media platform is added, determine if it provides an API or if manual data extraction will be needed.
#### Step 2: Develop Integration Scripts
- Action: Follow the API or file-based integration steps as outlined above to integrate new data sources.
- Scripts: Write Python scripts for API calls, CSV parsing, or web scraping.
#### Step 3: Validate Data Format and Schema
- Action: Ensure that the new data sources are validated for schema consistency and completeness before ingestion.
## 4. Data Validation
### 4.1 Schema Validation
- Ensure that the incoming data matches the expected schema (field names, data types) for each platform.
- Set up automated schema validation processes to catch schema mismatches or missing fields.

### 4.2 Data Completeness
- Verify that all expected records are present and no critical fields contain null or missing values.
- Set up alerts for missing or incomplete data.

### 4.3 Consistency Checks
- Ensure that data is consistent across platforms (e.g., the same user has matching records across LinkedIn and GitHub).

## 5. Error Handling
### 5.1 API Errors
- Rate Limiting: Ensure retry mechanisms are in place for API calls that hit rate limits.
- Authentication Errors: Set up error logging for authentication failures and configure auto-retry for token refreshes.
- Data Fetch Errors: If the API call fails, log the issue and send an alert for further investigation.
### 5.2 File Processing Errors
- File Corruption: Set up validation checks to detect and skip corrupted files.
- Missing Files: Trigger alerts for missing files during scheduled ingestion windows.
## 6. Logging and Monitoring
### 6.1 Logging
- Log all API requests and responses for troubleshooting purposes.
- Log all data ingestion events (success/failure) for auditing.

### 6.2 Monitoring
- Use Azure Monitor or Databricks to track the health of the ingestion pipelines.
- Set up real-time alerts for failed API calls or ingestion jobs.

## 7. Conclusion
This data source integration guide ensures that external data sources are ingested seamlessly into the personal growth data pipeline. By following the steps for API-based and file-based integrations, and adhering to data validation and error handling best practices, you can maintain consistent data quality and reliable pipeline operations.
