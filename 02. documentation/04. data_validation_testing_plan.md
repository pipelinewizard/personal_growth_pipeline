# **Data Validation Testing Plan for Personal Growth Data Pipeline**

## **Introduction**
This document outlines the testing plan to validate the accuracy, consistency, and quality of the data processed in the personal growth data pipeline. The purpose of data validation testing is to ensure that data ingested, transformed, and served by the pipeline meets the necessary quality standards, adheres to business rules, and is fit for analytics and machine learning models.

---

## **1. Objectives**
The objectives of this data validation testing plan are:
- Ensure data completeness, accuracy, and consistency across all stages of the pipeline (ingestion, transformation, storage, serving).
- Verify that the data meets the required schema and format standards.
- Ensure that the data aligns with business rules and domain-specific requirements.
- Identify and handle any data quality issues before data is processed for reporting or machine learning models.

---

## **2. Validation Scope**
Data validation will be conducted at multiple stages of the data pipeline:
1. **Ingestion**: Validate the data as it is ingested from external sources (LinkedIn, Substack, GitHub).
2. **Transformation**: Validate the transformed data for correctness and alignment with business rules.
3. **Storage**: Validate data stored in Azure Synapse Analytics or Azure Data Lake to ensure proper format and accessibility.
4. **Serving**: Validate the final data presented in reports or dashboards, ensuring the data is ready for analytics and machine learning.

## **3. Data Validation Tests**
### **3.1 Schema Validation**
Ensure that the structure of incoming data matches the expected schema.

- **Test 1**: Verify that all required fields are present in the data.
    - **Validation**: Compare the incoming data schema (field names, types) to the expected schema.
    - **Success Criteria**: All fields match the expected schema.
- **Test 2**: Check data types for each field.
    - **Validation**: Ensure that numeric fields, strings, and dates are in the correct format.
    - **Success Criteria**: All fields are in the correct data type format (e.g., date fields contain valid dates).

### **3.2 Completeness Validation**
Ensure that all expected data is present and there are no missing or null values for critical fields.

- **Test 1**: Verify data completeness.
    - **Validation**: Ensure that no required fields contain null or missing values.
    - **Success Criteria**: No critical fields should contain null or missing values.
- **Test 2**: Check for gaps in time-series data (e.g., daily LinkedIn followers).
    - **Validation**: Validate that there are no gaps in the time-series data for metrics that are expected to be continuous.
    - **Success Criteria**: Data is complete with no missing dates.

### **3.3 Uniqueness Validation**
Ensure there are no duplicate records for unique identifiers.

- **Test 1**: Validate the uniqueness of key fields (e.g., user IDs, project IDs).
    - **Validation**: Check for duplicates in primary key fields.
    - **Success Criteria**: No duplicate records for key fields.

### **3.4 Consistency Validation**
Ensure consistency across related datasets or fields.

- **Test 1**: Validate that related data fields are consistent (e.g., matching user IDs across datasets).
    - **Validation**: Ensure consistency across linked data (e.g., user records should match across LinkedIn and GitHub datasets).
    - **Success Criteria**: No inconsistencies between related fields across datasets.

### **3.5 Data Transformation Validation**
Ensure that data transformation logic produces correct results.

- **Test 1**: Verify the results of calculated fields (e.g., project completion rates, total followers).
    - **Validation**: Ensure that derived or calculated fields are computed correctly based on source data.
    - **Success Criteria**: Calculated values match expected results.

- **Test 2**: Validate data aggregation.
    - **Validation**: Ensure that aggregations (e.g., total projects, engagement rates) are performed correctly across datasets.
    - **Success Criteria**: Aggregated values match the expected totals.

---

## **4. Business Rule Validation**
Ensure the data aligns with domain-specific business rules.

- **Test 1**: Validate against defined business rules.
    - **Validation**: Ensure that the data adheres to predefined business logic (e.g., valid project statuses, follower counts within acceptable ranges).
    - **Success Criteria**: Data conforms to all business rules.

- **Test 2**: Verify time windows for metrics (e.g., monthly project completion rates).
    - **Validation**: Ensure data is aggregated correctly for predefined time windows (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
    - **Success Criteria**: Data is correctly aggregated over the defined time periods.

## **5. Data Quality Reporting**
### **5.1 Validation Reports**
Generate detailed reports summarizing the results of data validation tests.
- **Content**: Include data quality metrics (completeness, accuracy, consistency), number of errors found, and detailed logs of any validation issues.
- **Reporting Tool**: Use tools like Power BI, Databricks notebooks, or custom Python scripts to generate the reports.

### **5.2 Alert Mechanism**
Set up automated alerts for data validation failures.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Use Azure Data Factory or Databricks to trigger alerts when validation checks fail.
- **Notification Method**: Email or other notification systems for reporting critical issues in the data pipeline.

---

## **6. Error Handling and Correction**
### **6.1 Automated Error Handling**
- **Mechanism**: Automatically correct common errors (e.g., missing values) during ingestion or transformation.
- **Fallbacks**: In case of data errors, trigger workflows to retry ingestion or flag the data for manual review.

### **6.2 Manual Review**
For data errors that cannot be automatically resolved:
- **Process**: Generate reports that identify specific data validation failures and assign them for manual correction.
- **Responsibility**: Data engineers or pipeline administrators to review and correct any validation errors.

---

## **7. Retesting and Continuous Monitoring**
### **7.1 Regular Retesting**
- **Frequency**: Conduct regular retesting of data validation, particularly after pipeline updates or when new data sources are added.
- **Scope**: Include retesting of all validation checks (completeness, consistency, transformation).

### **7.2 Continuous Monitoring**
- **Monitoring Tools**: Use Azure Monitoring, Power BI, or custom scripts to continuously monitor data quality in the pipeline.
- **Drift Detection**: Monitor for data drift (e.g., changes in data patterns) that could affect the quality of reports or machine learning predictions.

---

## **8. Data Validation Success Criteria**
The data validation process will be considered successful if:
- All required fields are present, complete, and consistent.
- No critical business rules are violated.
- Data is correctly transformed and aggregated.
- All validation errors are either automatically handled or flagged for manual correction.

## **9. Conclusion**
This data validation testing plan ensures the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the data processed in the personal growth data pipeline. By implementing thorough validation at every stage, we can guarantee that the pipeline produces trustworthy analytics and machine learning results.
