## **1. Dashboard Wireframes**
This section outlines the visual layout of the dashboard, describing how the metrics will be displayed and interacted with.

- **Wireframes**: Include wireframe sketches or designs for each dashboard view.
  - **Overview Dashboard**: A summary page displaying key metrics from Skill Development, Community Contribution, and Professional Development at a glance.
  - **Detailed View**: A page where users can drill down into specific categories or metrics, such as completed projects or LinkedIn engagement.
  - **Recommendations Panel**: A section providing suggestions or personalized recommendations based on current metrics and predicted trends.
  
- **Mockups**: Visual mockups of the dashboard, illustrating how it will look to the user. This includes the placement of filters, tables, graphs, and drill-down features.

## **2. Data Fields and Metrics**
This section details the data points that will be tracked and displayed on the dashboards.

- **Skill Development**: 
  - Data fields: Project completion dates, certifications earned, books/articles read.
  - Metrics: Total projects completed per month, certifications earned per year.

- **Community Contribution**: 
  - Data fields: LinkedIn engagement data, Substack readership, articles published.
  - Metrics: Followers gained per month, impressions per post, comments received per post.

- **Professional Development**: 
  - Data fields: Job applications, interview feedback, networking events.
  - Metrics: Job offers received, clients secured, leadership development courses completed.

## **3. Filtering and Drill-downs**
The dashboard will allow users to filter data and drill down into specific areas to gain deeper insights.

- **Filtering Options**:
  - **Time Range**: Users can filter metrics by specific time periods (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually).
  - **Platforms**: Filters will allow users to view data by platform (LinkedIn, Substack, GitHub, etc.).
  - **Categories**: Filter by Skill Development, Community Contribution, or Professional Development.

- **Drill-down Capabilities**:
  - Users can click on metrics (e.g., total followers gained) to drill down into more detailed views (e.g., a breakdown of followers gained per month or per post).
  - **Example**: Clicking on "Completed Projects" will show detailed information on each project (e.g., date completed, skills used, and outcome).

## **4. Data Refresh and Update Frequency**
This section outlines how often the data will be updated to reflect new metrics and activity.

- **Real-time Updates**: For platforms with API integrations (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub), data will be refreshed in real time as new activity occurs.
  
- **Batch Updates**: For data sources with manual input or delayed updates (e.g., personal certifications or books read), batch updates will occur at regular intervals (e.g., daily or weekly).

## **5. Recommendations and Insights**
The system will analyze historical data to provide personalized insights and growth recommendations.

- **Skill Development Recommendations**: Based on recent project completions, the dashboard will suggest additional learning paths or certifications.
  
- **Community Contribution Insights**: The system will analyze social media engagement trends and suggest optimal times to post or content ideas based on past performance.
  
- **Professional Development Path**: Based on job applications or networking events, recommendations for improving interview success or securing clients will be provided.

## **6. Data Visualization Types**
The dashboards will display data using various visual elements to make insights more accessible.

- **Bar Charts**: For comparing metrics like projects completed or LinkedIn followers gained over time.
  
- **Line Graphs**: For tracking trends, such as engagement growth or project completion rates across months.

- **Pie Charts**: For illustrating percentage breakdowns, such as content contributions across platforms (e.g., LinkedIn vs. Substack).

- **Tables**: For presenting detailed data such as individual projects, books read, or courses completed.

## **7. Data Security and Access Control**
The dashboard system must adhere to data security principles to protect sensitive personal data.

- **Role-based Access Control**: Different roles will have varying levels of access. For example, a user might only have access to their own data, while an administrator could view aggregated reports.

- **Data Encryption**: All data displayed in the dashboard will be encrypted both in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access.

## **8. Data Export and Reporting**
Users will have the ability to export data for offline analysis or further reporting.

- **Export Formats**: Dashboards can be exported in formats such as CSV, PDF, or Excel for easy sharing and analysis outside the system.

- **Scheduled Reports**: Users can set up scheduled reports to be generated and delivered via email on a regular basis (e.g., weekly or monthly summaries).
