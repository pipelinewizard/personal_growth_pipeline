## **2. Non-Functional Requirements**
*This section outlines scalability, security, reliability, and data governance for the system to ensure consistent performance and safeguard personal data.*

### DataOps: Objective - Maximize Automation and Stability
- **Principle**: Prioritize automation to minimize failures and manual intervention.
    - Automate all stages (extraction, transformation, reporting) with error handling and CI/CD.

### Data Architecture
- **Principle**: Enable flexible scaling and modular updates.
    - Use scalable cloud infrastructure, decoupling components for independent updates.

### Data Security
- **Principle**: Safeguard data privacy and security.
    - Apply encryption and RBAC, with audit logs for sensitive data.

### Data Management
- **Principle**: Ensure data quality and traceability.
    - Enforce retention policies, track data lineage, and manage metadata.

### Orchestration
- **Principle**: Efficiently manage dependencies and task scheduling.
    - Use orchestration tools to manage tasks, with error handling and retry logic.

## **3. System Architecture**
*This section describes the architecture, including data extraction, transformation, warehousing, and reporting.*

- Data is extracted from sources using **Azure Data Factory** and stored in **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**.
- Data is transformed using **Azure Databricks** for personal growth analysis and stored in **Azure Synapse Analytics** for querying and reporting.
- **Power BI** provides interactive dashboards and reports, while machine learning models (using **Azure Machine Learning**) generate predictions on growth trends.
