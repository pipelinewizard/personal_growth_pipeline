Documenting Daily Data Engineering, Goals, Blockers, and Learnings

Goals for the Day:
- Continue revising values, objectives and key results
- 
-

Blockers Encountered:
-
-
-

Summary of Progress Made:
- Consolidated Personal Growth Value into 2 objectives - and begin revising key results for each objective
- Also deleted value driven pipeline and broke down to seperate repositories
-

Next Steps:
- Need to create respositories for the major parts of the value driven pipeline and push to github
-
-

General Notes:
- For the Personal Growth domain It seems like the mosty important metric is time - and the key results really reflect the dimensions of that time spent. How many hours did you spend writing articles, how many hours did you spend reading books, how many hours did you spend working on personal projects etc.
- I've realized that for the Personal growth value - my two major objectives when it comes to data engineering is
    - Enhancing my knowledge and skillset in data engineering
    - Making meaningful contributions to the data engineering community
- Ive realized that the Personal Growth report is the main project. All the other domains that I mentioned are seperate sub projects e.g. Finanical Transactions, Health and Well Being, and Family and Relationships. These are all seperate projects
